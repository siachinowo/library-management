my notes


MISSING FUNCTIONALLITY:
No way to view due dates for checked out books
No late return penalty system
No book reservation system

POTENTIAL BUGS:
No validation for duplicate book/member IDs

Menu system is tightly coupled with Library class???????????



Input validation for IDs and dates
- Error handling for duplicate items/members
Serialization for data persistence
- Support for different item types beyond books
Late return penalties
- Reservation system
- More detailed search functionality
Unit tests
- Type hints
Configuration management
